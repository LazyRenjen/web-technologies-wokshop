       Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
       <br>

        In 1914 Watson became president of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, a maker of electrical punch-card computing systems and other products; the company changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation in 1924. An exceptional salesman and organizer, Watson assembled a highly motivated, well-trained, and well-paid staff. He gave pep talks, enforced a strict dress code, and posted the now famous slogan “Think” in company offices.
      <br>

     Watson, Jr., remained as president of IBM through to the commitment to build the System/360 machines, on which base IBM has developed almost all mainframe systems for 30 years. After serving for 10 years as chairman of the board until 1971, he continued to serve as the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation until 1979, by which time IBM's annual sales had reached $23 billion.
